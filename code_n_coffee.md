## theories
controlling electricity
flow is controlled by circuit
simple circuit
series circuit
parallel circuit
## hardware
* breadboard, ravine
* resistor in circuit - smaller flow of current
* LED, flat edge, in from short leg, out from long leg
* sensor basic
    * VCC - power in
    * GND(Gound) - power out
    * OUT(PUT) - power out
    * AO - analog output
    * DO - digital output, only this allowed for rpi!
## software
variables
functions
inputs
outputs
## python
compact, less lines
terse, less keywords
dynamically typed
control characters, no ;
